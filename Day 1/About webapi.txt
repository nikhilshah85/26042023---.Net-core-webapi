1. This is all about data exchange
2. In todays world, organizations has lot and lot of data
	They need to share this data with 
		other teams
		other organizations
		other applications
		etc...

Refer to MS Paint Diagram

3. We had WebServices for the same - since 2003 - this was very very useful and many application were created 	using the same 
	-- it used SOAP based packets (XML) to exchange data
	-- which is very heavy in terms of size, speed and storage - not suitable in todays mobile data world
	-- It had a lot of features missing, which was resolved in Advance Web Services (WCF)
	-- Still not enough

4. we now have more light weight data, which can travel faster
	JSON - Javascript object notation 

	new standards for more proficient way of exchangeing the data
	REST - Representation State Transfer

	Thus based on Rest standards, Microsoft created compilers,namespaces,  classes, methods, attributes etc
	and added it to .Net Core version 
	This component is called webAPI
