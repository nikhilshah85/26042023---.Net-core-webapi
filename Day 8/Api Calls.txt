		Consume WebAPI - Consume RestFul Service - Call a webapi - read/write JSON data 

	there are 2 ways to make a call

	a. from Client Side to webapi - here client directly hits the api server
		Client end framework - script
			JQuery
			Fetch API (mostly used - it is a part of standard) - built into every browser
				Javascript based call
			Angular, React, Node, Knockout, backbone etc...


			--This is fastest, but less secure
			--should not be used for scencetive data like, username/password, credit card etc.
			--cannot be used for desktop application
	
	b. from server side - here client goes to server and server makes the api call
			HttpClinet - it is a part of standard
	
				This is more secured, a little bit slower
