1. Repository pattern 

			This is a pattern for data source

		1. in the inital phase - we do not have proper data design, structure, architecture etc..
			thus we want to work dummy data

			so we choose - in memory collection (List / array, etc...)

		2. When data starts to grow, collection is not enough, we restart the server, we loose data 			etc..

			Thus move to database - sqlServer Express - free one

		3. when application progressed, users has grown, data grown, request ,response increased, 			sqlexpress needst to be replaced

			Thus move to SQL Server - but need to purchase licnce - 6 months comes free, thus we 			went with and changed the code to use SQL Server - lot of efforts

		4. after months management said, buy oracle licence this is less costly
			Thus move to Oracle - weeks of efforts and time

		5. Client says, why not change to NoSQL - mongoDB
			Thus again a lot of efforts

		6. We now have an Enterprise licence for Azure
			please shift to Azure
		7. AWS, Big data, hadoop, data lake etcccc.....
			story goes on

			Database is changeing, but more efforts are put in frontend / middleware to achive that change
