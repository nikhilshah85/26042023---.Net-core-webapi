Today : Create a webapi application with CRUD operations on SQL Server
		useing Entity Framework Core

		Entity Framework is the name of - framework by Microsoft, part of .Net core
		based on open source design pattern - ORM 
			object relational mapping


		it will map all the objects from backend to frontend and wise-versa

		--Database will be mapped to a file in application - DBContext file
		--Table will be mapped to a file in application - (POCO class)
		--columns of table - mapped to properties in a POCO class
		--Constraints - relations will be mapped in a POCO class
		--Stored Procedure will be mapped to a function in application 

	---------------------------There are 2 approaches supported in .net with EF

1. Database first approach - here u create database and tables first and application will be useing EF core to    generate POCO classes (Plain C# Object - POCO)
2. Code First approach - here u write POCO classes in application and database and tables will be created by framework on server
